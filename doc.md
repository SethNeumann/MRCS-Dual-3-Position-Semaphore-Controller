MRCS-Dual-3-Position-Semaphore-Controller based on Arduino Nano

Based on the PCR Arduino clinic board which was a project board for a basic Arduino class.

    - 69x100 mm with cutouts for 2 SG90 servos facing in so they can be used for a 2 bladed semaphore or train order board or with the servo horns facing out it 
    should be useful as a grade crossing controller in HO or N.
    - Each servo has 3 analog inputs for adjustment pots, to set positions for STOP, APPPROACH and CLEAR 3 active low inputs for blade position (but the code will be at the STOP position in the abscence of any input, so you could get away with 2 inputs) to keep the same inputs as a search light or type "D" stoplight style signal, and an output for a servo
